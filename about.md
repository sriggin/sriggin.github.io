I'm a technology enthusiast. I worked in a datacenter for about 4 years, so I could do without hardware support for the rest of my life. I worked in an integration team for an enterprise content management system for about 4 years, so I could do without looking at an ERP for the rest of my life. I've been working at a storage company for about 4 years, and I could do without hearing another plea for "more nodes" for the rest of my life.
